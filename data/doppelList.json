This Doppel sprouts thorns to resist those who would harm it and attacks ferociously when it senses danger. On rare occasions, the agitated emotional state of its master may cause it to explode, and its shell â€“ though stronger than metal â€“ will break and release a surge of powerful magic.",

It is a freakish kind of vengeance brought upon by a past of suffering at the hands of others, a reversed and bloated projection of the self. There is not an ounce of guilt in it, only pure madness. This Doppel binds those it faces in numerous leashes and crushes them with its gargantuan hands as it trembles in endless ecstasy.",

It transmutes her ego into a sphere, while her ties and obligations to her family become snakes binding it tightly together in place. The sphere yearns for freedom, but the snakes confining it are the only things maintaining its form. Were it to wrest itself free, the sphere would burst and fly away...but the master would never allow that to happen.",
